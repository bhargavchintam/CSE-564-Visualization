# Lab 2a - Assignment

Welcome to the repository for the CSE-564 Visualization course. This repository hosts datasets, assignments, and additional resources that are integral to the coursework and facilitate the students' understanding and application of data visualization principles and techniques.

## Folder Structure for Lab 2a

The repository is organized into different folders and files, which are structured as follows:

- `Lab 2a - Assignment`: Contains all the materials and instructions for Lab 2a, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, and visualization dashboards.
- `static`: This directory houses the CSS and JavaScript files (`style.css` and `script.js`) which are responsible for the styling and interactivity of the visualization dashboard.
- `templates`: Includes HTML files like `index.html`, which is the main file rendered in the browser to display the dashboard.
- `app.py`: The Python Flask application that serves the visualization dashboard and handles data processing and routing.
- `kidney_disease_dataset.csv`: The dataset used in the visualization project, providing data on kidney disease for analysis.
- `test.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that may contain preliminary testing and exploration of data and visualization concepts.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore when making commits.

## Lab 2a Overview

Lab 2a is focused on implementing a web-based visualization dashboard that incorporates PCA, K-Means clustering, and scatter plot matrices. The assignment involves processing the `kidney_disease_dataset.csv` to extract meaningful insights and present them in an interactive manner using a Flask web application.

## Running the Code

To run the visualization dashboard:
1. Ensure Python and the required libraries (Flask, pandas, sklearn, etc.) are installed.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
3. Execute `python app.py` in the terminal to start the Flask server.
4. Access `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to interact with the dashboard.
